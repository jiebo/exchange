# Exchange Guide

This is a website that houses my exchange experience in 2015. It is built upon the Wordpress backend but the template is built from scratch with a couple of libraries being used. This website was conceived primarily to catalogue my experience and as an opportunity to practice front-end development work.<br>
It includes 3 main sections, a Pre-Departure Info, a City Guide, and an Expense Guide.

## Pre-Departure Info

This section categorises the different aspects of my exchange and show practical tips on how to shorten the learning curve while abroad.

## City Guide

Most of the cities I've visited during my exchange is displayed in this section. It also includes important information like the VAT rules, whether the tap water is potable and an rough estimate of the city's cost of living.
I intend to add a photo gallery when Google Photos releases their API since that's where I've stored my photos

## Expense Guide

A carousel display powered by Owl Carousel.
The first stage is a city expense breakdown based on my own data.
